TimberWinR Release Notes
==================================
A Native Windows to Redis/Elasticsearch Logstash Agent which runs as a service.

Version / Date
### 1.3.24.0 - 2015-04-29
1. Fixed potential bug in TailFiles when tailing log files which are partially flushed
   to disk, it now will not process the line until the \r\n has been seen.
2. Added Generator input.

### 1.3.23.0 - 2015-04-23
1. Fixed bug with parsing a single json config file, rather than reading
   JSON files from a directory.
2. Diabled elasticsearch outputter ping by default and parameterized the ping capability.

### 1.3.22.0 - 2015-04-14
1. Fixed minor bug with TailFiles and service re-starts not picking up
   rolled files right away.

### 1.3.21.0 - 2015-04-13
1. Rolled Udp listener support to V4 only, too many issues with dual mode sockets
   and hosts file.  If we want to add this back, I will add a Udpv6 input.

### 1.3.20.0 - 2015-04-03

1. A re-factoring of Logs and TailLogs to be more efficient and detect log rolling correctly,
   this requires http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/172190 which will be detected and
   set by TimberWinR, however, requires a reboot.
2. Fixed issue [#38](https://github.com/Cimpress-MCP/TimberWinR/issues/38) diagnostic output not showing drop flag for Grok filter.
3. Created TimberWinR.TestGenerator for complete testing of TimberWinR
4. Fixed ipv4/ipv6 thread-safe issue with UdpInputListener which might lead to corrupted input data.

### 1.3.19.1 - 2015-03-03

1. Added new Redis parameter _max\_batch\_count_ which increases the _batch\_count_ dynamically over time 
   to handle input flooding.   Default is _batch\_count_ * 10 

### 1.3.19.0 - 2015-02-26

1. Added support for Multiline codecs for Stdin and Logs listeners, closes issue [#23](https://github.com/Cimpress-MCP/TimberWinR/issues/23)
2. Added new TailFiles input type which uses a native implementation (more-efficient) than using LogParser's Log
3. Updated Udp input listner to use UTF8 Encoding rather than ASCII
4. Reduced noisy complaint about missing log files for Logs listener
5. Fixed bug when tailing non-existent log files which resulted in high cpu-usage.
6. Added feature to watch the configuration directory

### 1.3.18.0 - 2014-12-22

1. Fixed bug introduced in 1.3.17.0 which changed the meaning of the delay for Elasticsearch, Redis and Stdout 
intervals to be interpreted as seconds instead of milliseconds.   1.3.17.0 should not be used.
2. Removed ability for installer to downgrade which was leading to leaving previous versions laying around (i.e. reverts 1.3.13.0 change)

### 1.3.17.0 - 2014-12-19

1. Continued work improving shutdown time by using syncHandle.Wait instead of Thread.Sleep

### 1.3.16.0 - 2014-12-19

1. Added logSource property to the Log input to facility the steering of log messages to different indices.

### 1.3.15.0 - 2014-12-12

future messages.
